    --------------

        Leap Year Check: Write a program that determines whether a given year is a leap year. A leap year is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400.

    Triangle Validity Checker: Write a program that takes the lengths of three sides of a triangle as input and determines whether the triangle is valid. A triangle is valid if the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side.

    Divisibility Checker: Write a program that checks whether a number is divisible by another number. For example, check if a number is divisible by 3, 5, and 7.

    Membership Test: Write a program that checks whether a given element is present in a list. Use boolean logic to return True if the element is found and False otherwise.

    Password Validation: Write a program that validates a user's password based on multiple conditions, such as length, complexity, and history (cannot reuse the same password).

    Student Grade Classification: Write a program that takes a student's score as input and classifies it into different grade categories (e.g., A, B, C) based on specific grade boundaries.

    Number Range Check: Write a program that checks whether a given number falls within a specified range. For example, check if a number is between 10 and 100.
